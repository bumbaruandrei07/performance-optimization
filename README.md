# Performance Optimization
The project involves the use of “Lazy evaluation” and “Caching” mechanisms to optimize the performance of a Java application. The project involves the implementation of a class, called "LazyNumberDetails", whose objects each store a natural number and provide the user (object) with the following details about the stored number: if it is a "prime", "perfect" or "magic" number. These verification operations are carried out as few times as possible, only when strictly necessary.
